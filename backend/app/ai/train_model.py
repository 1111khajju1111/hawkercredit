    Trains a Scikit-Learn RandomForestClassifier on SYNTHETIC training
    profiles and persists the model file to
    backend/app/ai/models/credit_rf_model.joblib.

    *** IMPORTANT - SYNTHETIC TRAINING DATA DISCLOSURE ***
    Every row used to train this model is procedurally generated (see
    below) from a hand-authored linear formula plus injected label noise.
    NONE of it comes from real hawker-vendor repayment outcomes. This
    model is a demonstration / prototype scoring mechanism only and has
    NOT been validated against real-world repayment data. This is
    reflected in `model_metadata["training_data_type"] == "SYNTHETIC"`
    and surfaced to end users via the credit-profile API disclaimer and
    the admin monitoring dashboard - it should never be presented as a
    production-grade, empirically-validated credit model.

    We use a CLASSIFIER (predicting P(repaid) via `predict_proba`) rather
    than a regressor predicting a continuous "probability" target
    directly, because repayment is fundamentally a binary outcome
    (repaid vs. defaulted/delinquent) - a classifier trained on binary
    labels and read via `predict_proba` is the methodologically correct
    way to estimate that probability, rather than regressing directly
    onto a synthetic continuous proxy value.
